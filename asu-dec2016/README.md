## Notes
* **This talk is focused on learning the broad strokes.**  This means the talk is fast-paced and it may be difficult to complete the demo during the talk.
* During the talk, it is recommended to **take notes and ask questions**.  If you want to do the demo, do it before or after the talk when you can set your own pace.
* I am using a Mac.  I will do my best to provide helpful links for Windows users.
